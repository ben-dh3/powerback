        q: 'What is POWERBACK?',
        a: 'POWERBACK is an election campaign donation service with a fresh approach for small-dollar donors, inspired by the 2021 #ForceTheVote movement. This movement encouraged progressive House members to demand a vote on Medicare For All. In the spirit of commitment, accountability, and healthcare as a human right, POWERBACK carries this concept into the fundraising world. We harness contributions from everyday people to celebrate politicians that honor their promises.',

        q: 'Why make my political contributions with POWERBACK?',
        a: 'POWERBACK stands out among online services that facilitate political donations. We are distinct because we exist for voters, citizens, and ordinary individuals, not as a tool for any specific politician claiming to represent you. No politician will get a single cent of any contribution through our service until Medicare For All is called for a vote. Our focus is on your voice and your impact.',

        q: 'How does POWERBACK work?',
        a: "It's simple. Use our search options to find Representatives who matter to you. Select to whom you'd like to make a Celebration to honor your campaign donation when Medicare For All is brought to the House floor for a vote. Then choose your Celebration amount and proceed with payment. For amounts exceeding $200 in a single campaign cycle, we ensure proper filing with the FEC, and this service is offered to you free of charge. Your voice matters.",

        q: 'What is a Celebration?',
        a: "A Celebration is a heartfelt commitment. When you make yours, POWERBACK holds it to be delivered to the intended campaign if and only if Medicare For All is brought to the House floor for a vote. Celebrations are not tied to any individual lawmaker's actions, but instead the occurrence of a roll-call vote as a legislative event, regardless of the outcome.",

        q: 'What does POWERBACK charge?',
        a: '3.00% plus 30-cents per Celebration for our payment processing service, Stripe. Other services may charge a 3.95% flat fee, which is cheaper by about a nickel for donations up until around $32, after which we start saving you money. Our goal is to ensure your support is impactful, while we keep the lights on.',

        q: 'Can I give to challengers or only incumbents?',
        a: 'Our strategy is to empower whomever holds office today to start representing you now. In this sense, POWERBACK may encourage incumbency as a side effect, but only to the degree that they continue serving the people during their terms. Failure here may prove to be a benefit for savvy challengers.',
