      section: 'Transparency',
      term: 'We are committed to maintaining transparency and complying with all relevant federal election laws and regulations regarding the management and use of donation funds. As a conduit for political contributions towards federal election campaigns, we will provide clear and accurate information to users regarding how donation funds are managed, allocated, and disbursed in accordance with applicable laws, including the Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA) and regulations issued by the Federal Election Commission (FEC).\n\nUsers will be informed about the allocation of donation funds to specific political campaigns and candidates, as well as any administrative fees or expenses incurred for facilitating the contributions. We will ensure that all contributions are properly disclosed, and information about the recipient campaigns will be made available to users in a transparent manner.\n\nIt is essential to note that political contributions may be subject to limitations and reporting requirements under federal election law. Users are encouraged to familiarize themselves with these legal obligations and exercise their donations accordingly.\n\nWe are committed to upholding the highest standards of integrity and accountability in managing political donations, and we encourage users to reach out to us with any questions or concerns regarding the handling of donation funds. Our aim is to foster an environment of trust and openness as we facilitate small-dollar individual political contributions towards federal election campaigns.',

    {
      section: 'Refunds and Donations',
      term: "While there's no technical time limit to issuing a refund through the API or in the dashboard, we recommend users create refunds no more than 90 days after a payment was created. Refunds issued within this period are more likely to behave as expected, ensuring successful fund transfers to your customer's bank. After 90 days, there is no guarantee of a refund, although we will always attempt to process refunds. It is the user's responsibility to verify the validity of the account or card number before initiating a refund for a charge made a long time ago. In cases where the account is no longer active, users may need to make alternative arrangements, such as issuing a check to the customer directly. For donations made under the condition that an elected official leaves Congress (e.g., loses re-election, dies, falls ill, retires, resigns, etc.), refunds will be processed in accordance with the agreed-upon terms. If refunds cannot be processed due to processing errors, users agree that the donation money will be given directly to Powerback to be used at Powerback's discretion. We do not guarantee the accuracy or completeness of the data provided on the web application. Users acknowledge that the data may contain errors and omissions.",
