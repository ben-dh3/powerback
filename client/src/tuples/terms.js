    section: 'Transparency',
    term: 'We are committed to maintaining transparency and complying with all relevant federal election laws and regulations regarding the management and use of donation funds. As a conduit for political contributions towards federal election campaigns, we will provide clear and accurate information to users regarding how donation funds are managed, allocated, and disbursed in accordance with applicable laws, including the Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA) and regulations issued by the Federal Election Commission (FEC).\n\nUsers will be informed about the allocation of donation funds to specific political campaigns and candidates, as well as any administrative fees or expenses incurred for facilitating the contributions. We will ensure that all contributions are properly disclosed, and information about the recipient campaigns will be made available to users in a transparent manner.\n\nIt is essential to note that political contributions may be subject to limitations and reporting requirements under federal election law. Users are encouraged to familiarize themselves with these legal obligations and exercise their donations accordingly.\n\nWe are committed to upholding the highest standards of integrity and accountability in managing political donations, and we encourage users to reach out to us with any questions or concerns regarding the handling of donation funds. Our aim is to foster an environment of trust and openness as we facilitate small-dollar individual political contributions towards federal election campaigns.',

    section: 'Refunds and Donations',
    term: "In addition to our payment processing vendor costs, users are charged about 0.1% (one-tenth of one percent) overhead to keep donations whole within one cent. While there's no technical time limit to issuing a refund through the API or in the dashboard, we recommend users create refunds no more than 90 days after a payment was created. Refunds will only be considered for cases where donations were made in some express violation of the Eligibility requirements. Refunds issued within this period are more likely to behave as expected, ensuring successful fund transfers back to users' bank. After 90 days, there is no guarantee of a refund, although we will always attempt to process refunds. It is the user's responsibility to verify the validity of the account or card number before initiating a refund for a charge. For donations made under the condition that an elected official leaves Congress before the end of their term (e.g., dies, falls ill, retires, resigns, etc.), refunds will be processed in accordance with the agreed-upon terms. If refunds cannot be processed due to processing errors or any other reason, users agree that the donation money will be given directly to POWERBACK to be used at POWERBACK's discretion. We do not guarantee the accuracy or completeness of any data we provide. Users acknowledge that the data they rely on to make spending decisions through us may contain errors and omissions.",
